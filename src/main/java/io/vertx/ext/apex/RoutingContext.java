/**
 * Represents the context for the handling of a request in Apex.
 * <p>
 * A new instance is created for each HTTP request that is received in the
 * {@link io.vertx.ext.apex.Router#accept(io.vertx.core.http.HttpServerRequest)} of the router.
 * <p>
 * The same instance is passed to any matching request or failure handlers during the routing of the request or
 * failure.
 * <p>
 * The context provides access to the {@link io.vertx.core.http.HttpServerRequest} and {@link io.vertx.core.http.HttpServerResponse}
 * and allows you to maintain arbitrary data that lives for the lifetime of the context. Contexts are discarded once they
 * have been routed to the handler for the request.
 * <p>
 * The context also provides access to the {@link Session}, cookies and body for the request, given the correct handlers
 * in the application.
